    <h3>Drug Addiction</h3>
<p align="justify">I am currently working on a project on drug addictions which combines the opponent process theory and the so called reward prediction error (RPE), a crucial mechanism involved in the process of learning which shapes our behaviors in order to maximize overall positive experiences. In our mode, the RPE can be represented as a surface which is divided in two regions:  the first one associated with a positive value of the RPE, and the second one associated with a negative value of RPE. The dynamics associated with naïve drug users is represented by a trajectory lying in the first region but, with time and repeated exposure to drugs of abuse, the trajectory will enter and remain into the second region defining the state of addiction.</p>

<h3>Cancer Dynamics</h3>
<p align="justify">I worked on developing mathematical model of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) which allows to describe and to predict the evolution of the disease. Instead of tracking hundreds to tens of thousands of changes in specific sets of genes, we consider the state of the genome as a particle undergoing Brownian motion in a double-well energy potential with two stable states (i.e., normal hematopoiesis and leukemia). Leukemogenic events alter the potential so that the energy barrier is lowered and the probability of the transcriptome particle moving from one stable state to another, i.e. from health to leukemia, is increased. This approach provides a novel approach to interpret and predict changes in gene expression over time as well as introduces the novel concept of an leukemogenic (oncogenic) force which determines the dynamics of state transition from health to leukemia.

<p align="justify">More recently I worked on a project in which we developed a mathematical model of predator–prey dynamics to explore the kinetics of CAR T-cell killing in glioma: the Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell treatment Response in GliOma (CARRGO) model.The model includes rates of cancer cell proliferation, CAR T-cell killing, proliferation, exhaustion, and persistence. We use patient-derived and engineered cancer cell lines with an in vitro real-time cell analyzer to parametrize the model. This model highlights nonlinear dynamics involved in CAR T-cell therapy and provides novel insights into the kinetics of CAR T-cell killing. The model suggests that CAR T-cell treatment may be tailored to individual tumor characteristics including tumor growth rate and antigen level to maximize therapeutic benefit.

<h3>DNA Methylation and disease development</h3>
<p align="justify">DNA methylation plays an important role in the development and progression of many common diseases. I am currently working on the extension of the concept of thermodynamics temperature to the DNA methylation state of the genome. In order to do so, I apply the Ising model and the statistical mechanics of phase transitions to study the correlation function associated with a sequence of methylated or unmethylated sites in the genome with data collected from the peripheral blood of a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia. In this framework, aging and disease development, can be seen as a time evolution of a thermodynamic system characterized by a well-defined thermodynamic temperature and information, or Shannon, entropy. Preliminary results shown that time evolution of this last quantity can be used to describe the progression of acute myeloid leukemia. I am also interested in extending this approach to study chromosome organization with a particular note of interest on the topic of X Chromosome inactivation.

<h3>Aging</h3>
<p align="justify">I developed a theoretical model which may provide a possible explanation on different rates of aging. In particular, I extended the concepts of physical space and time to an abstract, mathematically-defined space, called “biological space-time” in which biological clocks operate. Assuming that a biological process may be represented as the motion of a point along a trajectory on a manifold, the concepts of precipitous or protracted aging can be described in terms of decelerating or accelerating motion of the point along the trajectory. As a consequence, precipitous (faster than chronological time) or protracted (slower) aging can be interpret as a dilation or contraction of time in the manifold in which the aging process occurs.

<h3> Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum fluids</h3>
<p align="justify">During my Ph.D I focused on studying the dynamics and the relaxation of a vortex gas from a non-equilibrium initial condition consisting of vortices and antivortices in a two-dimensional Bose Einstein condensate.
