and Prof. <a href="https://www.csun.edu/~dorsogna/">Maria Rita D'Orsogna</a> and my current research interests lie in psychophysics,  drug addition, behavioral dynamics. I am also interested in applying theoretical physics models to biological processes such as aging, disease development, as well as cancer dynamics.
